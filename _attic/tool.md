Tooling
=======

qooxdoo's tool chain comes with the SDK and comprises tools that help you create and maintain your %{JS} applications. They fall into two broad categories:

-   command-line tools
-   browser-based tools

Command-line tools are tools that run on your operating system's command shell, like *bash* for MacOSX and Linux, or *cmd* or *PowerShell* for Microsoft Windows. They generally require a Python installation on your system. Two important examples of this category are *create-application.py*, sort of an application wizard which you use to create a new application, and *generate.py* which you use during your development activities (and referred to as the "generator"), e.g. to build a running application from your source code.

Browser-based tools run in a web browser. Among them are the Apiviewer, which provides an interactive API reference, and the Testrunner, which allows running your unit test in a GUI.

As the browser-based applications are mostly described elsewhere, this section deals mainly with the command-line tools. It also provides a general introduction into the qooxdoo SDK and its structure.
