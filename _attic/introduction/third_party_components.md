Third-party Components
======================

The qooxdoo project makes use of components and tools from other projects and endeavours. This applies to the framework %{JS} class code, the tool chain, and static resources. This page gives an overview over those components which are included with the SDK or other deliverables. Please refer to the contained files for version information of a particular component.

Besides foreign files we have included in the project, we also want to list the tools we use to either produce or consume genuine files of our source tree (beyond basic text editors ;-), so it is easy to oversee all the project's dependencies.

Framework %{JS} Code
--------------------

These are components that are integrated into the framework class code. I.e. if you are using classes from the framework to create your custom application, chances are that these components will make it into the deploy version of your application.

Application %{JS} Code
----------------------

These are components that are used by the %{JS} code of our demo apps. I.e. if you are using classes from the framework to create your custom application none of these components will ever make it into your application.

Resources
---------

Static resource files, like images, CSS, etc. Static resources are frequently included in custom application, so it is very likely some of them will make it into your own custom application.

Tool Chain
----------

These are the Python modules we use that are not self-written nor part of a vanilla Python 2.6 SDK. While they are shipped with our SDK they are only used while the tool chain runs, and never become part of the resulting custom application.

These are the Node.js modules we use that are not self-written nor part of a vanilla Node.js v0.10+. While they are shipped with our SDK they are only used while the tool chain runs, and never become part of the resulting custom application.

Components or tools that are not included with the SDK
------------------------------------------------------

These tools we use on our development machines, e.g. to prepare the %{qooxdoo} SDK, run automated tests, create reports, and the like. They are not required to use any of %{qooxdoo}'s deliverables, but can be interesting for users that pursue specific interests.
