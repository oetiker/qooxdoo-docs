Data Binding
============

Data binding is a [concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binding) by which two data items are bound, so that changes to one are propagated to the second, and vice versa. This requires the possibility to detect such changes during runtime. In qooxdoo, class properties
\<pages/understanding\_properties\#understanding\_properties\> fulfill this requirement.

Using data binding allows you to e.g. keep two widgets automatically synchronized over the runtime of your application, although they might be spatially separated and have wildly different visual representations (e.g. a text field and a spinner).
